#### _Current State_  
I'm a beginner of markdown syntax and I just learned something new
 ``` html
 type *text* the text will be bold
 
 type _text_ it will be italic  
 
 "#" represents the size of the heading  
 For example:
 # text = biggest heading
 ###### text  = smallest heading
 ```
 Looking forward to learn more!
